# Get Started
Clone the project down unto your computer.
This project uses node.js, so you will need to install the dependencies. 
Install node.js if it doesn't already exist in your system,
and then run the following command in the project folder:
```
npm install
```

# Try the solution
Then run the following command to start the development server:
```
npm run start
```
This hosts the web application locally at port 3000.
The solution consists of two pages, one for validating and visualization individual structures,
and another for validating restructurings.
