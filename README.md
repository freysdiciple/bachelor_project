# Get Started
Clone the project down onto your system.
This project uses the node.js runtime environment, so you will need to install it if it doesn't already exist in your system from https://nodejs.org/en. Once you have it installed, run the following commands in the project folder, to install the needed dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Afterwards run:
```
npm install antlr4
```

# Try the solution
Then run the following command to start the development server:
```
npm run start
```
This hosts the web application locally at port 3000.
Please use Google Chrome when testing the project. If your default browser is another browser,
just open Google Chrome and paste 'localhost:3000' into the search bar after starting the server.
The solution consists of two pages, one for validating and visualization individual structures,
and another for validating restructurings.
